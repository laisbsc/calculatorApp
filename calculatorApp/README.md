# calculatorApp
simple calculator app created using HTML, CSS &amp; JS (no frameworks)

The application was developed as a tech-test regarding Phase 2 of the Front-End Development Internship for Distilled SCH.

[work on a bit more documentation]
1. instructions on how to open / use;
2. upload code to codepen as well?
3. keep commiting changes. :)
